        Party of a simple adventure with friends, The Traveling Taste Buds
        became a business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following the many cooking recipes that have reached us on our contact
        form on the first site,
        <br /> the idea came to us of creating a second site which allow us to
        list thousands of different recipes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is our team of enthusiasts : - CÃ©dric Priouret - Matisse Famularo -
        Miguel Santos - Christophe Castan
